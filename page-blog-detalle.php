                        I've been there. Just once <mark>I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity</mark> who
                        isn't stupid. What am I, the pope? Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to
                        me, tell them I died robbing some old man. This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant!
                        Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they
                        feel. That makes me feel angry!</p>
                    <p>For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet
                        honored. Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as
                        'the brig'. Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! I like cooking too.
                        Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some
                        old man. Well, thanks to the Internet. I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept
                        the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Comes with double prize
                        money.</p>
